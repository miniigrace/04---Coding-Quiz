# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Task and Descritpion

At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, Iâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

This Challenge invites me to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
